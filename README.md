A python program built on top of Radia that builds a cyclotron model based on the IsoDAR HCHC-XX design. 
It can :
- calculate the field,
- export the pole as VBA macro to build a CAD model in Inventor
- optimize the pole elevation and angular extension (top shim and side shim) for isochronicity 

It currently has some limited capability to modify the base cyclotron design, which I will hopefully expand and generalize in the future.
