A python program built on top of [Radia](https://github.com/ochubar/Radia) that builds a cyclotron model based on the [IsoDAR HCHC-XX](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjs/s11734-025-01983-4) design. 
It can :
- calculate the magnetic field with or without the use of symmetries
- optimize the pole elevation and angular extension (top shim and side shim) for isochronicity 
- export the pole as VBA macro to build a CAD model in Inventor
- visualize the cyclotron

It currently has some limited capability to modify the base cyclotron design, which I will hopefully expand and generalize in the future.
